        Most scholars believe the main purpose of the <em>hints</em> command
        is to annoy players.  They're probably right!  Who needs these stupid
        hints?  It's a simple game, you can figure it out on your own!  You
        can disable the stupid hints by typing "hints off".  Or if you like
        being bothered by a spam of green, you can turn hints back on by
        typing "hints on".
