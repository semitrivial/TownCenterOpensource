        Paperwork, paperwork!  Sometimes you feel like you could drown in it.
        Fortunately, you've got the <dfn>cancel</dfn> command to rescue you.  Type
        this command to stand up and flip the desk over, and all that stupid
        paperwork with it.  And then go outside and kill some baddies.
        (Translation:  The "cancel" command is used to close any forms that
        you have open in the right panel.)
    </div>
