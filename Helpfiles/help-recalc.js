        Sometimes, the gods are fickle.  If you wake up one morning to
        find that your prized 500,000 trillion HP have been suddenly replaced
        with a plebeian 100 HP, or something like that, you should try using
        the "recalc" command.  This command will re-calculate your core stats
        from your upgrades.
